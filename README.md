This repository provides a modular AI Assistant plugin for [Backstage](https://backstage.io/), enabling conversational AI, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and tool integrations for developer portals.

- **Real-time Voice Conversations** - Talk to your AI assistant with low-latency voice chat, powered by Azure OpenAI Realtime API.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** - Your assistant has access to your organization's knowledge base, including documentation, code, and catalog information.
- **Tool Calling** - Let your AI decide when and how it needs to perform actions or search for new knowledge.
- **Unified Context** - Both text and voice assistants access the same tools and knowledge base for consistent responses.
- **Modular Extensions** - Easily add new models, data sources, or tools through plugin modules.
